            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THAT upon the Death of <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Writ iſſued for electing a Knight of of the Shire, to ſerve in his place, for the County of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Writ was delivered to the Sheriff the latter end of <hi>December</hi> laſt, and the next County-Court was the 10th of <hi>January</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>That about 10 Days before the Election the Sheriff, to avoid any pretence of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and for the eaſe of the Country, cauſed publick Proclamation to be made in all the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Market-Towns in the County, That the Election would be the 10th of <hi>January,</hi> at <hi>Chelmsford;</hi> and that the Election would be ended that day, if poſſible: And the Sheriff ſet up that Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Writing, at the moſt publick Place in the ſaid Market-Towns.</p>
            <p>That on the day of the Election, the Writ was read between 10 and 11 a Clock, a Poll was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and granted, and the Court was adjourned for an Hour, to ſettle the method of taking the Poll.</p>
            <p>That the Sheriff, during that Adjournment, acquainted the Candidates (who were Sir <hi>Eliab Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Honywood</hi>) he intended to proceed, in the Poll, in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he had cauſed a Booth to be erected adjoining to the Shire-houſe, in the Market-place in <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> and Conveniencies there for 12 Clerks to take the Poll; That he had prepared 12 Books which he had ſigned and ſealed, and put each Clerk's Name thereto, who he had appointed to take the Poll, and ſhewed the ſaid Books to the Candidates; That he had directed 12 Perſons to attend the Clerks, and adminiſter the Oath to the Freeholders; That the Clerks ſhould be Sworn, truly to enter the Votes of all the Perſons that ſhould be polled; and the other Perſons ſhould be Sworn, duly to Swear all the Freeholders before they were polled; and that the Candidates might have Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perviſors at each Book.</p>
            <p>But it being then objected, That the Freeholders ought to be Sworn in the Sheriff's Preſence, and the Booth being divided by a Partition, he could not ſee them on each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the Sheriff, thereupon directed the ſaid Partition to be taken down; which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>Then the Sheriff went to the Court, according to his Adjournment, and from thence immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjourned to the Booth, and proceeded to take the Poll; where the Clerks, appointed to take the Poll, were firſt Sworn; then the Perſons appointed to Swear the Freeholders, and every Perſon that was polled, were likewiſe Sworn in the Sheriff's Preſence; and none admitted to Poll, but ſuch as were firſt Sworn.</p>
            <p>That the Candidates had each of them Superviſors at each Book; and the Sheriff continued in the Booth, from the beginning to the end of the Poll.</p>
            <p>That before 4 of the Clock in the Afternoon, ſeveral of the Clerks ſitting ſtill for want of Pollers, the Sheriff ſent into all the publick Houſes to call the Freeholders to the Poll; and for two Hours together, cauſed ſeveral Proclamations to be made on each ſide of the Booth, and at the Shire-houſe; in which time there were not above forty or fifty Perſons polled.</p>
            <p>That about ſix of the Clock, the Sheriff began to take up the Books, and went from Table to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and took and ſealed them up himſelf, but left one Book open till about 7 a Clock; and then cauſed ſeveral Proclamations to be again made, both at the Booth and Shire houſe, and finding no more Perſons come in to be polled, cloſed the Poll, and adjourned the Court for an Hour, to caſt up the Poll.</p>
            <p>That at the caſting up the Poll, Mr. <hi>Honywood</hi> being preſent, and not Sir <hi>Eliab Harvey,</hi> the Sheriff ſent to him to come, who refuſed; but ſeveral of his Friends were there, in whoſe Preſence the Books were opened, and they aſſiſted in caſting up the Poll, upon which the Numbers appeared to be, for
